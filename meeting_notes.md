# Meeting Notes

## 09-05-24

First meeting of the semester. Our next meeting is scheduled for next Thursday (09-12-24) same time, 10 AM. Goal for next meeting is to have a working barebone prototype. 
- User can upload image
- simple ml model inference
- model prediction displayed
- heatmap of image

The Web App should have clear installation instructions, enough so a lay person could run the app. We debated the utility of the HeatMap. Overall we came to the decision a more Hierarchial approach would do a better job than the heatmap can accomplish. 

### SECOND DEADLINE (2 WEEKS)

The second deadline we discussed having is a finalized fully trained model. We had a discussion about class weights. Advisor wants me to have complete understanding about every tool and framework I use. So moving forward I am going to attempt to use less things that I already fully understand. Essentially saying use less ChatGPT. 

### HIERARCHIAL VS ONE 

We also discussed Hierarchial Neural Networks. I made the case that a simple massive NN could do a better job than an hierarchial NN because it will be able to capture more complex relationships directly, without the need for redefined hierarchies. I compared it to the Tesla Full Self Driving stack. Tesla turned theer 100 ML models into simply just one massive model that takes photons in (images) and outputs only steering and pedal controls. Check out this super unknown talk by a former Tesla AI engineer where he explains the idea.
